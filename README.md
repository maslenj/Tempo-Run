# Tempo-Run

Tempo Run is an app developed in Swift which allows users to play music at different rates based off of the speed that they are travelling at. Currently it is only possible to play songs which have been manually added to the app, so if you want to try it out, you will have to add your own songs. Work on this app has currently been discontinued do to Apple's location services not quite being accurate enough to provide a positive user experience, but development may start up again later.
